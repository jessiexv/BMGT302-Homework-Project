# BMGT302-Homework-Project

## Overview
This is one of my homework projects I completed in my business programming class. We were given a scenario where we hypothetically worked at a local non-profit wanting to perform advocacy work based on global merchandising export amounts. We were tasked with pulling data from the CIAâ€™s World Factbook (data was already extracted for the assignment) and we needed to develop an easy way to be able to quickly view the relevant data. 

## How It Works
1. First we needed to create a Python script that will read all data from the file and store it in memory.

2. Then I wrote code that woudl display a message to the user to inform them that the data has been loaded and is ready for querying. 
It would also include the number of countries available to query.
