# BMGT302-Homework-Project

## Overview
This is one of my homework projects I completed in my business programming class. We were given a prompt where we hypothetically worked at a local non-profit wanting to perform advocacy work based on global merchandising export amounts. We were tasked with pulling data from the CIAâ€™s World Factbook (data was already extracted for the assignment) and we needed to develop an easy way to be able to quickly view the relevant data. 


## How It Works
* First, we needed to create a Python script that will read all data from the file and store it in memory.

<br>

* A message to the user would appear to inform them that the data has been loaded and is ready for querying. It would also include the number of countries available to query.

<br>

* Then, when a user enters a country name, such as "United Kingdom," the program will provide the export amount in billions. If a user only enters a single letter for the country name, such as "Z," the program will provide an export amount, in billions, as part of an output for all countries starting with that letter (i.e., "Zambia" and "Zimbabwe").

<br>

* When the user enters an invalid country name or a single letter that does not match any country names, the user will be informed that there are no matches.
