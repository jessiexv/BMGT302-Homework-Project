# BMGT302-Homework-Project

## Overview
This is one of my homework projects I completed in my business programming class. We were given a prompt where we hypothetically worked at a local non-profit wanting to perform advocacy work based on global merchandising export amounts. We were tasked with pulling data from the CIAâ€™s World Factbook (data was already extracted for the assignment) and we needed to develop an easy way to be able to quickly view the relevant data.
